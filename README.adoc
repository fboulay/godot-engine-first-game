This is the implementation of the step by step tutorial of Godot Engine to create a first game : https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html

== Run the game

Open the project in the Godot Game Engine editor and play the project (default shortcut is F5).
